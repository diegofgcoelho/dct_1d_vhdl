# dct_1d_vhdl

This project is a hardware description in VHDL of a 1D DCT core using algebraic integer based representation.

The files are organized in three different folders, design source, simulation sources (test benches), and constraint sources (master file for a Xilinx FPGA).

The project was synthetized for a Xilinx FPGA, achieving maximum operating frequency around 178 MHz.
